Description: Provides tools for species distribution modeling using H3 hexagonal grids,
  according to Uber Technologies Inc. (2022) <https://h3geo.org>. Includes functions to retrieve species occurrence records, generate
  H3 grids, compute landscape metrics, and prepare spatial data for modeling workflows with
  modern SDM algorithms. Useful for biodiversity and landscape ecology research.
