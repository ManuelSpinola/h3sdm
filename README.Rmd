# h3sdm

**h3sdm**: Machine learningâ€“based spatial species distribution modeling and habitat/landscape analysis using H3 spatial index grids.

## Overview

**h3sdm** is an R package for **species distribution modeling (SDM)** and **habitat analysis** using hexagonal spatial index grids based on [H3](https://h3geo.org/).

It provides a consistent spatial framework to combine species occurrence data with environmental predictors and landscape metrics, enabling both ecological modeling and habitat characterization. The modeling framework is built on **tidymodels**, offering flexibility to use different approaches (e.g., logistic regression, GAMs, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Key features include:

- Conversion of point occurrence data into **H3-based spatial grids**
- Extraction of environmental and landscape predictors at different resolutions
- Support for multiple modeling approaches through **tidymodels**
- Tools for visualizing model predictions and habitat structure

By leveraging **H3 grids** and the **tidymodels** ecosystem, **h3sdm** makes it easy to bridge **species distribution modeling** and **landscape ecology** in a scalable way.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **h3sdm from** [GitHub](https://github.com/) using one of the following methods::

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ManuelSpinola/h3sdm")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ManuelSpinola/h3sdm")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ManuelSpinola/h3sdm")
```



## Get Started

Explore full workflows and examples for **h3sdm** in the [Articles](https://manuelspinola.github.io/h3sdm/articles/) section.  
Each vignette demonstrates different aspects of species distribution and habitat analysis using H3 grids.
