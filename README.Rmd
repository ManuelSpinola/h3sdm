**h3sdm**: Machine learningâ€“based spatial species distribution modeling and habitat/landscape analysis using H3 spatial grids.


# h3sdm

## Overview

**h3sdm** is an R package for **species distribution modeling (SDM)** and **habitat analysis** using hexagonal grids based on [H3](https://h3geo.org/).  

It provides a consistent spatial framework to combine species occurrence data with environmental predictors and landscape metrics, enabling both ecological modeling and habitat characterization.

Key features include:  

- Conversion of point occurrence data into H3-based spatial grids.  
- Extraction of environmental and landscape predictors at different resolutions.  

- Support for multiple modeling approaches (e.g., logistic regression, GAMs, Random Forest, XGBoost).  

- Tools for visualizing model predictions and habitat structure.  

By leveraging H3 grids, **h3sdm** makes it easy to bridge **species distribution modeling** and **landscape ecology** in a scalable way.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **h3sdm from** [GitHub](https://github.com/) using one of the following methods::

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("ManuelSpinola/h3sdm")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ManuelSpinola/h3sdm")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ManuelSpinola/h3sdm")
```



## Get Started
