\title{Creates a 'recipe' object for Generalized Additive Models (GAM) in SDM.}
\usage{
h3sdm_recipe_gam(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An \code{sf} (Simple Features) object containing the species
presence/absence/abundance data, environmental variables (e.g., bioclimatic),
and the geometry (e.g., H3 centroids or points).}
}
\value{
A \code{recipe} object of class \code{h3sdm_recipe_gam},
ready to be chained with additional preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization).
}
\description{
This function prepares an \code{sf} (Simple Features) object for use in a
Species Distribution Model (SDM) workflow with the 'mgcv' GAM engine
within the 'tidymodels' ecosystem.

The crucial step is extracting the coordinates (x, y) from the geometry and
assigning them the \strong{predictor} role so they can be used in the GAM's
spatial smooth term (\code{s(x, y, bs = "tp")}). It also assigns special
roles to the 'presence' and 'h3_address' variables.
}
\details{
\strong{Assigned Roles:}
\itemize{
\item \code{outcome}: "presence" (or the column containing the response variable).
\item \code{id}: "h3_address" (cell identifier, not used for modeling).
\item \code{predictor}: All other variables, including \strong{x} and \strong{y}
for the GAM's smoothing function.
}

\strong{Note on x and y:} The \code{x} and \code{y} coordinates are added to the
recipe's internal data frame and are defined as \strong{predictor} to meet the
requirements of the \code{mgcv} engine.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'data_sf' is your sf object with 'presence' and 'h3_address'
# gam_rec <- h3sdm_recipe_gam(data_sf)
# Add normalization only to bio variables, excluding x and y
# final_rec <- gam_rec \%>\% step_normalize(starts_with("bio"))
