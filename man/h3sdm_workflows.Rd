\title{Create multiple tidymodels workflows for H3-based SDMs}
\usage{
h3sdm_workflows(model_specs, recipe)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_specs}{A named list of \code{tidymodels} model specifications
(e.g., \code{logistic_reg()}, \code{rand_forest()}, \code{boost_tree()}), where each element
specifies a different modeling approach to be included in the workflow set.}

\item{recipe}{A \code{tidymodels} recipe object, typically created with \code{h3sdm_recipe()},
which prepares and preprocesses the data for modeling.}
}
\value{
A named list of \code{workflow} objects, one per model specification.
}
\description{
Creates a list of tidymodels workflows from multiple model specifications and a prepared recipe.
This is useful for comparing different modeling approaches in species distribution modeling
using H3 hexagonal grids. The returned workflows can be used for model fitting and resampling.
}
\details{
This function automates the creation of workflows for multiple model specifications.
Each workflow combines the same preprocessing steps (recipe) with a different
modeling method. This facilitates systematic comparison of models and is
especially useful in ensemble and stacking approaches.
