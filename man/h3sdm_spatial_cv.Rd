\title{Create a spatial-aware cross-validation split for H3 data}
\usage{
h3sdm_spatial_cv(data, method = "block", v = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An \code{sf} object, typically the output of \code{h3sdm_data()}.}

\item{method}{Character. The spatial resampling method to use:
\describe{
\item{"block"}{Use \code{spatial_block_cv} for block-based spatial CV.}
\item{"cluster"}{Use \code{spatial_cluster_cv} for cluster-based spatial CV.}
}}

\item{v}{Integer. Number of folds (default = 5).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying \code{spatialsample} function.}
}
\value{
An \code{rsplit} object (from \code{rsample}) representing the spatial CV folds.
}
\description{
Generates a spatially aware data split using the \code{spatialsample} package.
This helps avoid inflated model performance estimates due to spatial autocorrelation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Block spatial cross-validation
spatial_cv_block <- h3sdm_spatial_cv(combined_data, method = "block")

# Cluster spatial cross-validation with 10 folds
spatial_cv_cluster <- h3sdm_spatial_cv(combined_data, method = "cluster", v = 10)
}
