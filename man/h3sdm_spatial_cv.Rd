\title{Create a spatial-aware cross-validation split for H3 data}
\usage{
h3sdm_spatial_cv(data, method = "block", v = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An \code{sf} object, typically the output of \code{h3sdm_data()}.}

\item{method}{Character. The spatial resampling method to use:
\describe{
\item{"block"}{Use \code{spatialsample::spatial_block_cv()} for block-based spatial CV.}
\item{"cluster"}{Use \code{spatialsample::spatial_clustering_cv()} for cluster-based spatial CV.}
}}

\item{v}{Integer. Number of folds (default = 5).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying \code{spatialsample} function.}
}
\value{
An \code{rsplit} object (from \code{rsample}) representing the spatial CV folds.
}
\description{
Generates a spatially aware cross-validation split for species distribution modeling
using H3 hexagonal grids. This helps avoid inflated model performance estimates
caused by spatial autocorrelation, producing more robust model evaluation.
}
\details{
Spatial cross-validation avoids overly optimistic performance estimates
by ensuring that training and testing data are spatially separated.
\itemize{
\item \code{"block"}: Divides the spatial domain into contiguous blocks.
\item \code{"cluster"}: Groups locations into spatial clusters before splitting.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example: Create spatial cross-validation splits for H3 data

# Block spatial CV with default folds
spatial_cv_block <- h3sdm_spatial_cv(combined_data, method = "block")

# Cluster spatial CV with 10 folds
spatial_cv_cluster <- h3sdm_spatial_cv(combined_data, method = "cluster", v = 10)
}
