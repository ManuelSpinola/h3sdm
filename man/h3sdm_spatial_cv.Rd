\title{Create a spatial-aware cross-validation split for H3 data}
\usage{
h3sdm_spatial_cv(data, method = "block", v = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An \code{sf} object, typically the result of \code{h3sdm_data()}.}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the spatial sampling method.
Options are "block" for \code{spatial_block_cv} or "cluster" for \code{spatial_cluster_cv}.}

\item{v}{The number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying \code{spatialsample} function.}
}
\value{
A \code{rsplit} object from \code{rsample} with a spatial data split.
}
\description{
This function creates a spatial-aware data split using \code{spatialsample},
which is crucial for avoiding inflated model performance due to spatial autocorrelation.
}
\examples{
# Use block cross-validation
# spatial_cv_block <- h3sdm_spatial_cv(combined_data, method = "block")
# Use cluster cross-validation
# spatial_cv_cluster <- h3sdm_spatial_cv(combined_data, method = "cluster", v = 10)
}
